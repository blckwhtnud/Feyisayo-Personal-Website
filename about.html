      Hey there, I'm Feyisayo Enuiyin, and I wear many hats on my journey. I'm a
      Product Manager, a Tech Founder, a speaker, and above all, a passionate
      Community Developer dedicated to advocating for and empowering youth. My
      driving force is all about creating positive impact, whether it's boosting
      the enrollment of marginalized youth in STEM (Science, Technology,
      Engineering, and Mathematics), crafting products that reshape how we live
      our lives, or inspiring change through my words.

      During my academic journey at McMaster University, I pursued a Bachelor's
      Degree in Chemical Engineering and took the lead in establishing the
      groundbreaking First Annual Entrance Scholarship. It was tailor-made to
      support Black Canadian students as they embarked on their first year of
      engineering at McMaster University, marking a significant milestone in
      Canada.

      In my professional life, I've found my sweet spot as a Product Manager,
      entrusted with enhancing the mobile app experience for one of Canada's
      major telecommunication providers. I thrive on the challenge of crafting
      user-centric products and get especially excited when it comes to
      integrating AI technology to revolutionize our day-to-day experiences. My
      role is all about ensuring seamless and effective interactions between
      users and telecommunication services.
