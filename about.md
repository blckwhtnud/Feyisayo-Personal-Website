      Hey there, I'm Feyisayo Enuiyin, and I wear many hats on my journey. I'm a Product Manager, a Tech Founder, a speaker, and above all, a passionate Community Developer dedicated to advocating for and empowering youth. My driving force is all about creating positive impact, whether it's boosting the enrollment of marginalized youth in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), crafting products that reshape how we live our lives, or inspiring change through my words.

      During my academic journey at McMaster University, I pursued a Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering and took the lead in establishing the groundbreaking First Annual Entrance Scholarship. It was tailor-made to support Black Canadian students as they embarked on their first year of engineering at McMaster University, marking a significant milestone in Canada.

      In my professional life, I've found my sweet spot as a Product Manager, entrusted with enhancing the mobile app experience for one of Canada's major telecommunication providers. I thrive on the challenge of crafting user-centric products and get especially excited when it comes to integrating AI technology to revolutionize our day-to-day experiences. My role is all about ensuring seamless and effective interactions between users and telecommunication services.

      I also serve as a Program Lead for Rise In STEM, a grassroots organization that provides comprehensive STEM programs for marginalized youth in the Greater Toronto Area. My role involves developing and implementing initiatives to increase the enrollment and engagement of marginalized youth in STEM education.

      Beyond my career, my heart beats for travel. It's a deep well of inspiration for me. My dream is to explore every country in the world, diving into diverse cultures, savoring global cuisines, and embarking on thrilling adventures. Travel enriches my life, broadens my horizons, and fans the flames of my creativity.

      In everything I do, my mission is to create a positive impact and serve as a role model to others. Alongside my professional endeavors, I hold dear my roles as a daughter, friend, aunt, leader and mentor continually striving to inspire those around me through my unwavering dedication and passion.
