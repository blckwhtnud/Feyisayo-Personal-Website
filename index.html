        Hello everyone, my name is Feyisayo short form Feyi (2 syllables)!! I am an Alumna from McMaster
        University,
        where I
        studied Chemical Engineering, and currently work in the software industry. Yea talk about a
        transition.

        I am passionate about a lot of things but more importantly advocating for the advancement and growth
        of
        more
        Black Youth in STEM.I hope to not only create impact and feasible changes within the black community
        but
        also become more knowledgeable in ways I can be a daily contributor to the changes i hope to see.
